      <description>The Museum of the Fur Trade is located on the James Bordeaux trading post, which has become an important historical site over the years. The trading post was established in the fall of 1837 as a site for the American Fur Company to conduct business with American Indians who spent their winters in the area.
Traders, Trappers, and Indians The Museum of the Fur Trade is dedicated to preserving the rich history of the North American fur trade.</description>
